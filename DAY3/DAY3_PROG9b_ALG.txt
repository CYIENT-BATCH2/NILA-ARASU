9b>ALGORITHM:BINARY FORM TO HEXA DECIMAL
	1)Taken the input as binary form and scan in long integer format and declaration is hex=0,i=1.
	2)Using goto label condition binary is not equal to zero.
	3)if condition is true we should find remainder of that binary number.	
	4)Next step is (hex+rem*i) this value is stored in hex,and i*2 is stored in i,
          and again loop will execute untill codition became false .
	5)Exit from the loop and print the value in hex format(%lx).
