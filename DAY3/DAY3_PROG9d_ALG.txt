9d>ALGORITHM:BINARY TO DECIMAL AND HEX
	1)Binary value is given by their requirements and to convert deciaml and to hex.
	2)Taken the input as binary form and scan in long integer format and declaration is hex=0,i=1.
	3)Using goto label condition binary is not equal to zero.
	4)if condition is true we should find remainder of that binary number.	
	5)Next step is (hex+rem*i) this value is stored in hex,and i*2 is stored in i,
          and again loop will execute untill codition became false .
	6)Exit from the loop and print the value in hex format(%lx) and decimal format(%d).
